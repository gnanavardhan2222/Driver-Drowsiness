# Driver-Drowsiness# Driver Drowsiness Detection System  

#  **Driver Drowsiness Detection System** is a real-time safety application designed to monitor a driver’s alertness and reduce accidents caused by fatigue. The system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect signs of drowsiness, such as prolonged eye closure, and provides timely alerts to the driver.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Detects driver drowsiness in real-time using a webcam.  
- **Eye Closure Detection**: Differentiates between normal eye blinks and prolonged closures indicative of drowsiness.  
- **Alert System**: Triggers visual or audio alerts when drowsiness is detected.  
- **Scalability**: Can be integrated with vehicle systems or wearables for advanced monitoring.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:  
  - OpenCV: For image processing and video frame analysis.  
  - dlib: For facial landmark detection.  
  - NumPy: For numerical computations.  
- **Hardware Requirements**: Webcam or camera-enabled device.  

## 📦 Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/driver-drowsiness-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd driver-drowsiness-detection
Install the required Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
